## Usage
![usage](examples/usage.png)
* Use this program to view prompts of images downloaded from the internet or generated by using SD.
  * An image can be opened using drag-and-drop.
  * Use the 'Open' button in the top left to choose a file.
* The gallery section below will display all images in the same folder as the currently viewed image.
  * You can click on an image in the gallery section
  * Also, you can use the 'a' or 's' keys on your keyboard to select an image.
* Clicking on the 'Refresh' icon will update the content in the gallery.
  * Only click 'Refresh' when there are changes made to the contents of the file folder.
  * When an image is opened or dragged and dropped, the gallery will be automatically updated.
* Others:
  * Since I don't have a Windows to test the default program for opening images, "Preview" will be disabled on Windows system.
  * (Important note) Do not delete the currently viewed image during use to avoid unexpected errors. Will address this issue in the next update.

## Test environment
```
Python 3.11
Macbook Pro16 M1 (OS 13.3.1 (22E261))
